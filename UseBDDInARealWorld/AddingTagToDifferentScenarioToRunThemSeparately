@single
Scenario: Consumer can add a book to shopping cart
	Given I open "http://www.amazon.com"
	When I search for "The Lean Startup"
	And I open the first book
	And I add the first book to shopping cart
	Then I should see the book in my shopping cart

@multiple
Scenario Outline: Consumer can add a book to shopping cart
