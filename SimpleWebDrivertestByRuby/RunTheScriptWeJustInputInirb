# Run the script we just input in "irb"

Firstly, we need to `touch sample.rb`

To close browser, we just need `driver.quit`.

Then we will open the "sample.rb" to edit it, and copy the script we just type in "irb" to it, then save.

Go back to "Terminal" and type `ruby sample.rb` to run the script, and you will see the same process we did in "irb", and see the two browser titles in "Terminal".

*Now you can see the browser titles are different from the first time and second time.*
