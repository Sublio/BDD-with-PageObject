Then we need to add following content to it.

<pre><code>Scenario Outline: Consumer can add a book to shopping cart
    Given I open "http://www.amazon.com/"
    When I search for "<book>"
    And I open the first book
	And I add the first book to shopping cart
	Then I should see the book in my shopping cart
