# Add assertion to both feature and step definition

We can aslo add assertion to verify the expected result shown. Take the browser title as an example, we can check whether partial of it contains some characters.

In "sample.feature", we need to add one step:

`Then I should see the browser title has "Cheese! - Google"`

And in "sample.rb", we need to add onbe step:

<pre><code>Then /I should see the browser title has "(.*?)"/ do |partial_title|
    @driver.title.include?(partial_title)
end
</pre></code>
